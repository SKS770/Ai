# 1) Write  python program to generate Calendar for the given month & year?.
import calendar
year = int(input("Enter year: "))
month = int(input("Enter month: "))
print("\n", calendar.month(year, month))


# 2)-Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. 
Refer the following graph as an Input for the program.[Initial 
#node=1,Goal node=7]. 
# Depth First Search (DFS) implementation in Python
# Define the graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    1: [2,3],
    2: [4],
    3: [2],
    4: [5, 6],
    5: [3, 7],
    6: [],
    7: [6]
}
# DFS function

        if neighbor not in visited:
            path = dfs(graph, neighbor, goal, visited)
            if path:
                return [start] + path
    return None
