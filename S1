#2nd question-Write a Python program to implement Depth First Search algorithm. 
Refer the following graph as an Input for the program. [Initial 


#node=1,Goal node=8]
#Depth First Search (DFS) implementation in Python
# Define the graph as an adjacency list

    2: [4, 5],
    3: [6, 7],
    4: [8],
    5: [8],
    6: [8],
    7: [8],
    8: []
}
